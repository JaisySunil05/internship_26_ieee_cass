# Peak Detector with Peak-to-Peak Interval Measurement | RTL-to-GDSII ASIC Design Flow

## Project Overview

This project implements a digital Peak Detector capable of identifying the highest value in a continuously incoming 8-bit signal stream and measuring the time interval between successive peak updates.

The design was developed in Verilog HDL and implemented through a complete ASIC design flow including RTL Design, Functional Verification, Logic Synthesis, Floorplanning, Placement, Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS), Routing, and Signoff Analysis using Cadence EDA tools.

The project demonstrates how a real-time signal monitoring system can be transformed from behavioral RTL code into a synthesizable and physically implementable ASIC design.

## Problem Statement

Many signal-processing applications require continuous monitoring of incoming data streams to identify significant events.

Examples include:

- ECG R-Peak Detection
- Biomedical Signal Monitoring
- Sensor Data Analysis
- Event Detection Systems
- Industrial Monitoring Systems

The objective of this project is to:

1. Detect new maximum values (peaks) in an incoming signal.
2. Store the latest peak value.
3. Measure the number of clock cycles elapsed between consecutive peak detections.
4. Generate a hardware-efficient architecture suitable for ASIC implementation.

## System Architecture

### 1. Clock Divider

The Clock Divider generates a periodic clock enable pulse.

**Functions:**

- Reduces effective sampling rate
- Controls peak evaluation timing
- Provides configurable division ratio

**Inputs:**

- clk
- rst_n

**Output:**

- clk_en

---

### 2. Peak Tracker Core

The Peak Tracker performs:

- Continuous monitoring of input samples
- Comparison with previously stored peak value
- Peak register update
- Peak interval calculation

**Inputs:**

- clk
- rst_n
- data_in[7:0]

**Outputs:**

- peak[7:0]
- interval[15:0]
- clk_en_out

---

## Working Principle

### Step 1

A timer continuously increments every clock cycle.

### Step 2

Whenever the clock divider generates a clock enable pulse, the incoming data sample is evaluated.

### Step 3

If:

```text
data_in > current_peak
```

then:

- Peak register is updated
- Interval register stores elapsed clock count
- Timer resets to zero

### Step 4

The process repeats continuously for all incoming samples.
